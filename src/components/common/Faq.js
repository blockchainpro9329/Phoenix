                            FIRE is a token that is designed to generate high-yield rewards for
                            you, by combining investment capital into DeFi yield protocols, decentralized reserve currency,
                            and other high yield large scale investments that are generally unsuitable for individual
                            investors.<br /><br />

                            FIRE uses a simple mechanism to redistribute the yield while

                            sustainability.<br /><br />You can create a Phoenix Nest with 10 FIRE tokens. Once your Nest is
                            created, it will generate rewards on an ongoing basis.
