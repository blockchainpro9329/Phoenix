                            FIRE is a token that is designed to generate high-yield rewards for
                            you, by combining more than 30 different DeFi yield protocols.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This means that you will be able to take advantage of a large
                            variety of yield-generating protocols, without having to find the
                            best ones yourself and conduct due-diligence, and without having to
                            pay for the fees of each platform.

                            FIRE uses a simple yet innovative mechanism to redistribute the
                            yield while supporting the growth of the token: the FIRE-nodes.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You can create a FIRE-node with 10 FIRE tokens. Once your node is
                            created, it canâ€™t be undone and it generates
                            <span className="c-purple" data-nsfw-filter-status="swf"> lifetime returns</span> in FIRE tokens for
                            you.

                            When a FIRE-node is created, 7 FIRE are transferred to the rewards
                            pool, 1 FIRE is added to the liquidity pool as 50% FIRE and 50% BNB,
                            and 2 FIRE are transferred to the marketing/team wallet to ensure
                            the stabilization of the whole protocol, and the token growth.

                            FIRE has just been launched (this means that you are still very
                            early) so our current focus is to ensure the

                            leveraging its powerful tokenomics designed for steady growth.

                            The next step of our roadmap is to begin navigating between
                            different DeFi yield protocols. That being said, you can receive
                            very high lifetime returns by creating FIRE-nodes.

                            Our goal is to bring DeFi into the average household. Ethereum's
                            high gas fees make it impossible for most people to access the
